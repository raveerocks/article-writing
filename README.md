# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Imagine a scenario when it is past midnight on a Saturday night. You are watching a show on Netflix with a bunch of your friends Alice, Bob, Carol and David. It’s 2 am and your friends plan to leave now. You have booked cabs for each of them that shows an ETA(Estimated Time of Arrival) of 20 minutes. Within 5 minutes you get a call from the cab customer service executive. He says  “Because it’s Saturday, we have a large number of bookings. the drivers are busy so it might take more than 30 minutes.”

What do you do next? Just wait for your cab and nothing much, right? That’s when one of your friends comes up with an idea. The idea for finding the shortest path. If you know the shortest path from your home to theirs, they can reach faster once the cab  arrives. All started brainstorming.

The drivers on field are busy taking customers from one place to another. As the bookings come in they ride the cab without even thinking of optimisation. Let’s handle this in a better way now:

Say, green marker  represents your home location in the map below. The markers stands for the each of their residents. In each of the scenarios below, find out which path driver should take to drop your friends.
